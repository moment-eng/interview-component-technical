# React Technical Interview

<img src="./.github/demo.gif" width="500"/>

## Introduction
Text editing and keyboard navigation is a primary feature of a canvas. This prompt is designed to assess a candidateâ€™s comfort in:
* sharing state between elements
* working with events
* managing DOM with react hooks

The goal of this exercise is to make as much progress with the prompt as possible. The allotted time may not be enough to complete the exercise but we are interested in learning about your approach to programming, how you think through problems, and communicate.

## Prompt
You will have around 35 minutes to make as much progress as you can with the following prompt. 

Starting with a create-react-app template, create a component as described below:
* Component comprises n number of individual input elements
* As user types, focus should advance to the next empty input field

[Optional] If you complete the above:
* Each input element may only hold one numeric character (0-9)
* As users presses backspace, focus should revert to previous input field

## Follow up
* What are some additional edge cases to consider with this component?
* How would you report the resulting value to a parent component (or shared state management like redux) in a way that is performant?
* What other functionality would you add to this component?

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
